# Portfolio Piece 1: "Basics in R Workshop" ~ Tutorial
This is the repository for my first portfolio piece - "Basics in R Workshop." This presentation was given to the Sleep, Stress, and Health (STEALTH Lab) on April 20, 2022 to introduce research assistants to R. This workshop was co-created with Angelina Venetto. 

The PowerPoint covers the following topics:
1. The value of learning R
2. An overview of R, RStudio, and GitHub
3. Instructions to download the software
4. Navigation of the RStudio interface 
5. Installing and loading packages
6. Assigning objects 
7. Running descriptive statistics 
8. Creating a plot 
* Note: Steps 3-8 were follow-along practice. Students wrote their own code as we went through the presentation.

The RMarkdown file used for the workshop is included in this repository.
